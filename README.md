# WP-Theme-Hunter
WP Theme Detective is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to detect the name of a WordPress theme used on any website. The app works by parsing the HTML code of the website and looking for the WordPress theme name in the link to the stylesheet.

The app is built using the tkinter library for the GUI and the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries for web scraping. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for users to enter a website URL and detect the WordPress theme used on the site.

This repository contains the source code for the app, along with the necessary dependencies and installation instructions. Users can clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the app on their local machine. The app can also be packaged as an executable file using PyInstaller for easier distribution.

WP Theme Detective is a useful tool for web developers and designers who want to find out which WordPress theme is used on a particular website. It is licensed under the MIT license, so users are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.
